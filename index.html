        <h1>💖 Ask Me Anything! 💖</h1>
        <p>Since I can't be there to help you move in, I made this little companion for you! I hope it brings a smile while you're unpacking and settling into your new home. If you're ever unsure about something—like which room to use or how to arrange things—just ask it a question. It can only say 'yes,' 'no,' or 'maybe,' but hopefully it adds a little fun to your day! </p>
